ercise 1: Simple Math Module

Create a new file named math_utils.py.

In it, define three functions:

add(a, b) → returns the sum

subtract(a, b) → returns the difference

multiply(a, b) → returns the product

Create another file named main.py.

Import math_utils and use the three functions.

Print the results.

Exercise 2: Greeting Module

Create a module called greet.py with functions:

say_hello(name) → prints “Hello, <name>!”

say_goodbye(name) → prints “Goodbye, <name>!”

In a separate file (main.py), import greet and use both functions.

Exercise 3: Student Info Module

Create a module named student_info.py containing a function display_info(name, age, grade) that prints student details.

In main.py, import that module and disp lay info for three students.
Exercise 4: Combining Multiple Modules

Create two modules:

math_utils.py (for arithmetic functions)

string_utils.py (for text-related functions like uppercase(text) and count_letters(text))

Import both modules into main.py.

Use at least one function from each module in the same program.
  
Exercise 5: Challenge

Create a module named bank.py that contains:

A global variable balance = 0
  
A function deposit(amount) that increases balance    

A function withdraw(amount) that decreases balance

A function check_balance() that prints the current balance

In main.py, simulate a few deposits and withdrawals by calling these functions.#
